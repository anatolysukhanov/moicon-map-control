 * No libraries are included by default. The framework's functionality is limited to just having access to several variables, which are:
 *  - framework.environment ('prod', 'dev' or 'test')
 *  - framework.assetversion (the version number that increases with every compile)
 *  - framework.config (the data found in app/config/configserviceworker.php)
 *  - framework.version (the dates/versions of the git repo's defined in app/config/compiler.php)
